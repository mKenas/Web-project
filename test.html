      <p>Explains why the problem is important from a social or technological perspective.  DONE

The world as a whole is becoming more tech oriented every day, yet there is one group in our society that is being left behind in this development. The older generation struggles to keep up with the digitalized world. It wasn't long ago that we used to receive invoices in the mail, to then log into our bank accounts to pay our bills. Now everything happens over the net, and you can easily set up a plan for paying your monthly bills. This might be easy for those accustomed to the internet and many of its amazing abilities to help us in our daily lives, but for the older generation that didn’t grow up with this kinda technology such tasks may seem impossible without any help.

In a survey done by Telenor in cooperation with the pension fund found that half of the Norwegian population, from the ages of 34-50, are struggling to keep up with technological advancements in society. The percentage only increases with age and many fear a digital division. In a different survey done by the same company shows that 19 percent of the older generation feel like outsiders, because they don’t use net based banking systems and other official services, the same amount even said to have a case of digital anxiety. The older generation thinks that the youngsters spend too much online, and fear that this may create a digital division between the generations. (We need to link the articles here :)
